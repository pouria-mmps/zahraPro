Apparently, Adblock Plus can remove Font Awesome brand icons with their "Remove Social
Media Buttons" setting. We will not use hacks to force them to display. Please
<a class="alert-link" href="https://adblockplus.org/en/bugs">report an issue with Adblock
    Plus</a> if you believe this to be
an error. To work around this, you'll need to modify the social icon class names.
